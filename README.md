## Pneumonia detection using Deep Learning

This is deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks for pneumonia detection.
The system labels an X-RAY lungs image as either virus, bacteria or normal.

The dataset was split as 80% training, 10% validation and 10% test set.
The main regularization technique that improved the accuracy was adding image augmentation.
Final accuracy is around 85% on the test set.

Everything was implemented in Keras/Tensorflow.
